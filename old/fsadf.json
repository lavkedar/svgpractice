This room is a continuation of another conversation.
Can't find the old version of this room (room ID: !umoLIEPdUevBsIDugo:gitter.im), and we have not been provided with 'via_servers' to look for it. It's possible that guessing the server from the room ID will work. If you want to try, click this link:https://matrix.to/#/!umoLIEPdUevBsIDugo:gitter.im?via=gitter.im

Hi, I am joining to ask for your help.
I got the following error :
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'point' of undefined
at new PaintHandler (svg.draw.js:27)
at e.draw (svg.draw.js:207)
at aaa.html:23

fom the standalone usage of svg.draw.js plugin as follows:

<div id="myDrawing"></div>
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
<script src="svg.min.js"></script>
<script src="svg.draw.js"></script>

<script>
    //var drawing = new SVG('myDrawing').size(500, 500);
    var poly2 = new SVG('myDrawing').size('100%', '100%')
        .polygon().draw({
            snapToGrid: 20
        });
</script>

Can you show me what's wrong with these codes?

I dont see anything wrong. Create a jsfiddle or codepen to show the issue in a real example

Thanks.

I also downloaded svg.draggable and executed manual-test.html without npm install.
and I got the following :

svg.draggable.js:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
manual-test.html:35
Uncaught TypeError: draw.rect(...).center(...).draggable is not a function
at manual-test.html:35

Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
manual test ist outdaten. it uses the wrong versions

hey guys, do you any idea how can I implement drawing lines as a polygon with the mouse?
Sun, Dec 27, 2020
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
Have a look at svg.draw.js
mhd21 (mhd21)
thanks
another question, If I apply stroke-width on a path or line, is it applied on coordinates of the path or line? can I get the points of the area of the stroke?
Mon, Dec 28, 2020
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
I am not sure what you are asking
you can not get the stroke area

Hi, How can I merge two shapes as a path?, for example, a Rectangle and a Circle
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
not with svg.js
however you can convert them to a path by hand by joining both path strings 
mhd21 (mhd21)
Thanks for the answer, the thing I want is to create a drawing tool that when drawing a circle and then a rectangle that has an intersection for the circle, both be merged.
do you have any Idea? I should do it with svgjs
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
this is an incedible complex topic. There is no way in svg.js to truely merge two shapes. However , you can just use a mask and mask a bigger rectangle with teh circle and rectangle. that will look like a merged shape.
mhd21 (mhd21)
thanks

This might be a really silly question, but if I do draw = SVG().addTo('body').size(100,100) can I later get the size from the draw object?
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
sure. width() and height() will get you the size
rossburton (Ross Burton)
So the question is why doesn't it work üòü
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
it does: https://codepen.io/fuzzyma/pen/zYKyMmV?editors=1111

rossburton (Ross Burton)
yeah, my code no doubt!
ha, forgot some ()
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
^^
rossburton (Ross Burton)
love how javascript was entirely fine with draw.width-2 :)
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
well thats definitely Not a Number üòÉ
rossburton (Ross Burton)
yeah i'm guessing size() just ignores NaNs
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
I am not sure üòÉ. Maybe it does set them which would be ignored by the browser and lead to the default size of 300x200 or so
rossburton (Ross Burton)
only slightly offtopic: if I want the stroke on text to be behind instead of on top of the fill, do i need two text objects?
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
yes
rossburton (Ross Burton)
bah to svg. but thanks.
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
its well defined. the stroke is not a border. 
rossburton (Ross Burton)
yeah, was just wondering if there was a way to alter the rendering order when both are set
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
never heard of it sorry ^^
rossburton (Ross Burton)
SVG.style() doesn't do what I expected. I may be doing something dumb again.
1
  draw.style(".header", {fill: "black", font: "20px ff-brokenscript-bc-web, serif"});
results in <style fill="black" font="20px ff-brokenscript-bc-web, serif">.header</style>
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
Wrong version of the docs
The method is named css()
rossburton (Ross Burton)
Huh, my js is pulling 3.0 and the docs is 3.0
Further dumb questions: TSpan.length(). what is that actually measuring and in what units?
rossburton (Ross Burton)
ah, points.
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
I am not even sure - either px or user units
rossburton (Ross Burton)
mdn says pt but the numbers appear to be px. just ignoring that and basking in the glory of wrapped text
I'm guessing that text wrapping is a 'bring your own' problem with svgjs and there's no helper?
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
Text wrapping is horrendously complex and can only be done by a numerical approach. I programmed it before but it's not nice. Mostly your best bet is to guess the line length and wrap it there. That makes the calculation far less complex 
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
I just realized that you are correct. Ofc the correct method is style()
I didn't read your code correctly üòÖ
And it seems like you discovered a bug. You can open an issue for that :)
rossburton (Ross Burton)
I'll file a bug
rossburton (Ross Burton)
https://github.com/rossburton/mausritter-item-cards/blob/main/svg.html#L53 is a pretty dumb but works wrap function if you know how wide in advance
svgdotjs/svg.js#1186 for the style() issue

style() doesn't write style correctly ¬∑ Issue #1186 ¬∑ svgdotjs/svg.js - GitHub
If I call draw.style() to create a top-level stylesheet: draw.style(".header", {fill: "black", font: "20px ff-brokenscript-bc-web, serif"}); This results in the following elements in the SVG: <styl...
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
looks quite good but doesnt support wrapping too long words üòâ
thx for the issue!
looks like you are writing a game arent you? ^^
rossburton (Ross Burton)
Well, printable cards for a RPG
size() says "Proportional resizing is also possible by leaving out height" but now I have an <image> with width=100 height=0
I'm guessing that's a caveat for images, where the proportions are not known until load time
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
thats true, but your issue is most likely that you didnt wait for the image to load. You have a load event which you can listen for and resize then

rossburton (Ross Burton)
Is centre-positioning a svg native thing or a convenience?  specifically can i centre an image before its loaded
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
just realized that the bug already has been fixed in master :)
for the time beeing you can work around by using draw.put(new SVG.Style()).rule(selector, obj)
rossburton (Ross Burton)
Ah cool, thanks
Any plans for a new release?
Also what sort of architecture-purist designed SVG filters. I just want to do <image blend="multiply"> not this abomination :)
rossburton (Ross Burton)
Hm. Doing .element("feBlend") to hand-code a blend is resulting in an element <feblend>
rossburton (Ross Burton)
Okay, some SVG help please. Minimal example at https://pastebin.com/YsAjYNqc: means to be a red square with a black-on-white placeholder multiplied on top so the white is effectively transparent.
<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http:/ - Pastebin.com - Pastebin
Pastebin.com is the number one paste tool since 2002. Pastebin is a website where you can store text online for a set period of time.
For me the image is invisible though
I'm guessing I'm doing something really dumb
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
iam really not good with filters
i can give you an example tho

rossburton (Ross Burton)
@Fuzzyma thanks for all the help so far
One more question :)
</columbo>
So if I have a <img> in a page, I can drag it to my desktop etc and the browser will save the file
Any idea how to do that with a svg generated with svgjs?
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
Google how to display an svg string in a canvas
You then can use the canvas instead
rossburton (Ross Burton)
is there an easy way to grab the svg as string?
Fuzzyma (Ulrich-Matthias Sch√§fer)
draw.svg()
rossburton (Ross Burton)
that's obvious üòâ
